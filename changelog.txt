Version: 2.1.3
  Bugfixes:
    - Accidentally broke all of bulk recycling (oops).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.1.2
  Bugfixes:
    - Bulk recycling recipe generation now skips non-stackable items (will figure out a better solution later).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.1.1
  Bugfixes:
    - Added a nil check to the bulk-recycling recipe generation function.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.1.0
  Features:
    - Added an optional Optimization Module (Disabled by default). They are made from one Speed Module 3 and Productivity Module 3 and are unlocked via the `Quantum Processor` research. They can be placed in beacons and provide a small boost to speed and productivity at the cost of increased power draw and pollution. They're useless in machines and are generally worse than speed modules in beacons, but can be optimal in situations where throughput is limited, such as the upper rarity tiers of beaconed quality upcyclers.
    - Added an optional Bulk Recycler (Disabled by default). Recycles four items at once in order to ensure that one item's worth of ingredients are always retrieved, thus preventing rng-related upstream bottlenecks in quality upcyclers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.0
  Major Features:
    - Sundered the mod in two! Now there is a Quality Library mod that allows anyone to easily add quality items (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/quality-lib). It's also a hard requirement for this mod (Factorio will download it for you). This mod now interfaces with that library while also adding the previous features.
  Features:
    - Added the option to change the Recycler's output position to the long side instead of the short side. This is useful for certain hyper-optimized Quality setups.
  Bugfixes:
    - Added a unique prefix to all entities, items, recipes, etc. This will unfortunately reset your settings, but will not break your save.
    - Added a tint to the Centrifuge 2 entity and item so that it can be more easily distinguished from the vanilla Centrifuge.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.9
  Features:
    - Added an optional Centrifuge 2 that is based on the stats of the Assembling Machine 3. Unlocked via Automation 3 research.
  Bugfixes:
    - Added Quality as a hard requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.8
  Features:
    - Added settings for speed module quality penalty.
    - Speed module quality penalty now defaults to no change from vanilla.
    - Added settings for quality module quality bonus (defaults to vanilla values).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.7
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed quality belt dragging from placing the original underground belt instead of a quality one.
    - Fixed the upgrade planner not interacting quality entities.
    - NOTE: You can select quality items for filters in an upgrade planner by going to the `unsorted` tab and selecting the specific quality .that you are trying to upgrade/downgrade. I'm not sure if fixing this is possible.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.6
  Bugfixes:
    - Entity replacement now supports Autobuild and other mods that place/revive entities via scripts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.5
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed Q-picked belts still having janky placement.
    - Fixed Q-picked undergrounds from not being spaced properly when dragged.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.4
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed modded items not being properly replaced due to incorrect control logic.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.3
  Features:

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed quality belt placement being super janky and weird.
    - Fixed underground belt dragging from not properly spacing the undergrounds.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
